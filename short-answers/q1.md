# Question

What is the primary difference between an HTTP GET request and an HTTP Post request?

# Answer
The primary difference is that HTTP GET is used for retrieving data from a server whereas HTTP POST is used for sending data to a server to create or update.

So this was good until you said that you are updating.
`POST` is only to send data to the sever/create data. `PATCH` and `PUT` are the only request that update.
