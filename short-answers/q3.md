# Question

Translate the following code into `async/await` please.

```js
const getAllUsers = () => {
  return fetch('https://example.com/users')
    .then(r => r.json())
    .then(users => {
      console.log('users:', users)
      return users
    })
    .catch(console.warn)
}
```

Make sure to keep all variable and function names the same. The function must behave the same way.


# Answer
```js
const getAllUsers = async () => {
  try{
    const response = await fetch('https://example.com/users')
    const user = await response.json()
    console.log('users:', users)
    return users;
  } catch(error) {
    console.warn(error)
  }
}
```

This is going to seem nit-picky, but this is something that can break your code base. When you are asked to use the same variables names, DO IT! When you don't you run the risk of breaking the code. That variable may be needed somewhere else so be careful.
