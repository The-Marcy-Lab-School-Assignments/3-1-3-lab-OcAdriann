# Question

What are at least 2 benefits to using:

```html
<script type="module" src="index.js"></script>
```

Instead of:

```html
<script src="index.js"></script>
```

# Answer
1. Using a script tag with a type of module gives that js file it's own isolated scope and does not popllute the global namescape.

2. We can use functions from those mudule js files in other js files useing import and export and keeps our code more organized.
