# Question

When we say "use semantic elements," what does that mean?

Please be sure to give an example of a semantic and non-semantic element in your explanation.

# Answer
That means we use elements/tag that describe it's meaning to both humans and the browser for accessability reasons.
```
<article>
  <h2>Semantic HTML</h2>
  <p>Tags are easier to read and more accessable with browsers and screen readers!</p>
</article>
